                <p>
                  Starting as an engineering office, over the years we have gained valuable competencies and experience that have enabled stable growth. Along with changes in partners and management, the company name was changed in 2006. Today, TEAM Automation Berlin is an efficient and competitive medium-sized company, present on international markets along with its subsidiaries. To provide global customer service, partnerships with local, audited companies have been established.
